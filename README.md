<h1> Single-Page CV </h1>

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a single-page Curriculum Vitae (CV) using only HTML. The primary objective is to learn how to structure a CV semantically and prepare it for future styling. The project covers essential aspects such as semantic HTML, SEO meta tags, Open Graph (OG) tags for social media sharing, and the inclusion of a favicon.

## Project Requirements

1. **Single-Page Layout** 
The entire CV should be presented on a single page with clearly defined sections.

2. **SEO Meta Tags** 
Include essential meta tags in the head section for better search engine optimization (SEO).

3. **Open Graph (OG) Tags** 
Add OG tags in the head section to enhance social media sharing, making your CV more shareable and visually appealing on platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook.

4. **Favicon** 
Add a favicon to your CV page for a polished and professional look.

5. **Semantic HTML** 

Use appropriate HTML tags to structure your CV, ensuring that each section (Education, Skills, Experience, etc.) is well-organized and semantically correct.

## Project Structure

1. **HTML Structures**
The CV is divided into sections including Personal Information, Education, Skills, and Career History. Each section is marked up using semantic HTML tags for clarity and structure.

2. **Head Section**
The head section includes essential meta tags for SEO, OG tags for social media sharing, links to the necessary files and a link to the favicon.

3. **Body Section**
The body section contains the main content of the CV, laid out in a clear and logical manner.

## Future Steps
In the future, the project will have the possibility of having a dark mode and the possibility of changing the language between English and Spanish.
